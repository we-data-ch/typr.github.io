:::

## Semicolon swallowing

Missing a `;` between two instructions could cause the second instruction to be silently absorbed into the first. This has been fixed — the parser now emits a `ForgottenSemicolon` warning.

## `//` is not a comment

TypR only recognizes `#` for comments. A `//` is now caught by a dedicated parser and treated as a comment with a `WrongCommentSyntax` warning.

## Single `=` is never a binary operator

Use `==` for equality testing. A single `=` is only valid in named fields, top-level assignment, and default parameter values.

## `record` vs `tuple` — the shape decides

`list{...}` and `:{...}` produce either a record or a tuple based on the shape of the elements, not the keyword.

## Type aliases need 2+ characters

A single-letter PascalCase alias (e.g., `type A <- int;`) is not parseable. Use at least 2 characters (e.g., `type Ab <- int;`).
